Native functionality for the [Whatever Dance Toolbox](https://github.com/dasantonym/wdt) NW.js implementation.

The code is based on parts of [ppgst](https://github.com/dturing/ppgst) by [Daniel Turing](https://github.com/dturing) and uses [node-opencv](https://github.com/peterbraden/node-opencv) for OpenCV functionality.

The build system is [cmake-js](https://github.com/unbornchikken/cmake-js).
